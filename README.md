## Overview

This project is a C-based assembler that processes assembly language instructions. It includes functionalities for macro processing, instruction validation, and more.

## Features

- **Macro Processing**: Define and use macros in your assembly code.
- **Instruction Validation**: Validate assembly instructions and their operands.
- **Addressing Methods**: Determine the addressing methods for operands.

## File Structure

- `preprocessor.h`: Header file for macro processing.
- `validation.h`: Header file for instruction validation.
- `preprocessor.c`: Source file for macro processing functions.
- `validation.c`: Source file for instruction validation functions.


## Status

This project is still in progress.
